# This file contains configuration options for harbored-mod (hmod).
#
# By default, hmod loads configuration from file 'hmod.cfg' in the directory from where
# hmod is running, if such file exists. These configuration options can also be passed
# as command-line options for hmod, overriding contents of the config file, if any,
# with the exception of options that allow multiple values (such as 'exclude' or
# 'macros') where the values specified as command-line options are *added* to the values
# in config file.



# Source code files or directories to document. Specify more than once to document more
# files/directories, e.g:
#
#   sources = ./sources
#   sources = ./thirdparty
#
# This will document both the source code in the ./source/ and ./thirdparty/ directories.
#
# For DUB (http://code.dlang.org) projects, './sources' is usually a good setting here.

# Modules or packages to exclude from generated documentation. Specify more than once to
# exclude more modules/packages, e.g:
#
#   exclude = tharsis.util
#   exclude = tharsis.entity.gamestate
#
# This will exclude both the package (or module) tharsis.util and module (or package)
# tharsis.entity.gamestate .
