==========
D:YAML 0.5
==========

This is a fork of the D:YAML library by kiith-sa (https://github.com/kiith-sa/D-YAML).
The intent of this fork is to provide a version suitable for use by dlang-tour, until
fixes are accepted upstream.

------------
Introduction
------------

D:YAML is an open source YAML parser and emitter library for the D programming
language.  It is
(`almost <https://github.com/kiith-sa/D-YAML/wiki/Differences-between-D:YAML-and-the-YAML-specification>`_)
compliant to the YAML 1.1 specification. D:YAML is based on
`PyYAML <http://www.pyyaml.org>`_ created by Kirill Simonov. 

D:YAML is designed to be easy to use while supporting the full feature set of
YAML. To start using it in your project, see the
`Getting Started <https://github.com/kiith-sa/D-YAML/wiki/Getting-Started>`_
tutorial and the `documentation <http://defenestrate.eu/docs/dyaml/>`_.

D:YAML is still a work in progress. Its API is not stable and there might be
compatibility breaking changes.


--------
Features
--------

* Easy to use, high level API and detailed debugging messages.
* Detailed API documentation and tutorials.
* Code examples.
* Supports all YAML 1.1 constructs. All examples from the YAML 1.1 specification
  are parsed correctly.
* Reads from and writes from/to YAML files or in-memory buffers.
* UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings are supported, both big and little endian
  (plain ASCII also works as it is a subset of UTF-8).
* Support for both block (Python-like, based on indentation) and flow
  (JSON-like, based on bracing) constructs.
* Support for YAML anchors and aliases.
* Support for default values in mappings.
* Support for custom tags (data types), and implicit tag resolution for custom
  scalar tags.
* All tags (data types) described at http://yaml.org/type/ are supported, with
  the exception of ``tag:yaml.org,2002:yaml``, which is used to represent YAML
  code in YAML.
* Remembers YAML style information between loading and dumping if possible.
* Reuses input memory and uses slices to minimize memory allocations.
* There is no support for recursive data structures.
  There are no plans to implement this at the moment.
